# calculator

Calculator created as a part of the Odin Project Curriculum

This project took me probably around 20 pomodoros or 8 1/2 hours. I worked on this project a little bit over the course of 3 days. After this project I don't feel super confident in my javascript, as I feel I did things in the most inefficent way possible. I'm probably going to spend today looking over calculator tutorials to see how I could have approached this project a little differently. Despite that, I am proud of this project. I didn't have to cheat at all, which makes me feel a little more confident in my ability to create something.
I feel a little more confident working with the DOM and think that I've improved my debugging skills quite a bit (console logging just about everything instead of just scratching my head when something unexpected happens.)
I know that this code is wet af ðŸ’¦ðŸ’¦ðŸ’¦ but I'm really scared to break everything right now. I'm well aware that this code is a house of cards.
