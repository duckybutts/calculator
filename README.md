# calculator

Calculator created as a part of the Odin Project Curriculum

Calculator built using the DOM. Pushes numbers to the stack and performs operations without using the built-in calc function. 

Personal Notes: 
This project took me probably around 20 pomodoros or 8 1/2 hours. I worked on this project a little bit over the course of 3 days. I'm probably going to spend today looking over calculator tutorials to see how I could have approached this project a little differently. Despite that, I am proud of this project. I didn't have to cheat at all, which makes me feel a little more confident in my ability to create something.
I feel a little more confident working with the DOM and think that I've improved my debugging skills quite a bit (console logging just about everything instead of just scratching my head when something unexpected happens.)
